# Gap Analysis: wmt_requirements.txt vs post-init_requirements.txt
## UPDATED 2025-07-28

## Overview

Direct comparison of desired packages in `wmt_requirements.txt` with actual runtime environment in `post-init_requirements.txt` (pip freeze output after extension initialization).

**Key Achievement**: rknn-toolkit-lite2 is now successfully installed, enabling BrightSign hardware-accelerated inference!

**Success Rate**: 87% of desired packages installed (54/62 packages)

## Current Status Summary

### 🎯 What's Working
- **87% success rate** with 54 out of 62 desired packages installed
- **rknn-toolkit-lite2** installed for hardware acceleration
- **Core CV/ML stack** functional with OpenCV, matplotlib, numpy, scipy
- **All basic utilities** installed (requests, PyYAML, redis, etc.)

### ❌ What's Missing (5 packages)
Deep learning frameworks and advanced image processing tools remain unavailable due to ARM64/Python 3.8 compatibility issues:

1. **scikit-image** - Advanced image processing (no Python 3.8 ARM64 wheels)
2. **torch** - PyTorch deep learning framework (ARM64 wheels available but complex dependencies)
3. **torchvision** - PyTorch computer vision extensions
4. **tifffile** - TIFF image format support (requires Python >=3.10)
5. **tzdata** - Timezone database (pure Python package, should be installable)

### ⚠️ Major Version Differences
Several installed packages have significantly older versions that may lack features or have compatibility issues with modern workflows.

## Package Categories

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Deep Learning Frameworks
- ❌ **torch==2.5.1** - PyTorch deep learning framework
- ❌ **torchvision==0.20.1** - PyTorch computer vision extensions

**Status**: ARM64 wheels available via PyPI and alternative sources, but Python 3.8 compatibility uncertain
**Python 3.8 Compatibility**: Older PyTorch versions (1.8+) have ARM64 support
**Impact**: Major - blocks modern deep learning workflows
**Strategy**: 
  - Try installing from official PyPI first: `pip install torch torchvision`
  - Alternative: Use KumaTea's repository for ARM64 builds
  - May need to use older versions (e.g., torch 1.13.x) for Python 3.8

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Advanced CV/AI Frameworks  
- ✅ **onnxruntime** - REMOVED from wmt_requirements.txt (commented out)
- ❌ **scikit-image==0.24.0** - Advanced image processing algorithms
- ✅ **ultralytics** - REMOVED from wmt_requirements.txt (commented out)
- ✅ **ultralytics-thop** - REMOVED from wmt_requirements.txt (commented out)

**scikit-image Status**: 
  - Version 0.24.0 requires Python >=3.10
  - No ARM64 wheels for Python 3.8 in recent versions
  - May need to build from source or use older versions (0.19.x)
**Impact**: Limits advanced image processing capabilities
**Strategy**: Use OpenCV + NumPy/SciPy for most image processing tasks

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - File I/O and Utilities
- ✅ **imageio==2.6.0** - INSTALLED (older version but functional)
- ❌ **tifffile==2025.6.11** - TIFF image format support
- ❌ **tzdata==2025.2** - Timezone database (missing but installable)

**tifffile Status**: 
  - Recent versions dropped Python 3.8 support (requires Python >=3.10)
  - For Python 3.8, need version < 2023.7.10
**tzdata Status**: Pure Python package, should be installable via pip
**Impact**: Medium - TIFF support limited to older versions
**Strategy**: 
  - Install older tifffile: `pip install "tifffile<2023.7.10"`
  - Install tzdata: `pip install tzdata`

## Revised Implementation Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: SDK Integration - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
**Successfully added to SDK:**
- ✅ python3-pip, python3-setuptools
- ✅ python3-markupsafe, python3-jinja2  
- ✅ python3-psutil, python3-tqdm
- ✅ python3-typing-extensions, python3-networkx

**Result**: These packages are now available at build time and runtime

### ✅ Phase 2: Runtime Installation - LARGELY SUCCESSFUL  
**52 packages successfully installed via pip**, including the critical matplotlib ecosystem!

### 🎯 Phase 3: Address Remaining Gaps (CURRENT PRIORITY)

#### Strategy A: Version Range Testing
Test older/newer versions of missing packages to find ARM64-compatible versions:

```txt
# Test these version ranges in enhanced wmt_safe_requirements.txt
torch>=1.13.0,<2.0.0           # Older versions may have ARM64 wheels
torchvision>=0.14.0,<0.16.0    # Match older torch versions  
onnxruntime>=1.16.0,<1.20.0    # Try earlier versions
scikit-image>=0.19.0,<0.24.0   # Earlier versions may work
imageio>=2.30.0,<2.37.0        # Version range for compatibility
ultralytics>=8.0.0,<8.3.0      # Earlier versions
```

#### Strategy B: Alternative Packages
Research drop-in replacements or alternative approaches:
- For torch: Consider TensorFlow Lite, ONNX alternatives
- For scikit-image: OpenCV + NumPy + SciPy may cover many use cases
- For ultralytics: YOLOv5 or other object detection frameworks

#### Strategy C: Custom Wheels
For critical missing packages, investigate building custom ARM64 wheels

### Phase 4: Documentation & Validation
- ✅ Document successful runtime installation approach
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for missing packages  
- [ ] Test alternative versions and packages
- [ ] Update user documentation with current capabilities

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-28  
**Status**: Major success! 91.5% of active packages available. Python 3.8 is the limiting factor.  
**Next Action**: Consider Python version upgrade path or accept current limitations with workarounds

## Fresh Comparison Analysis (2025-07-28) - COMPLETE REVIEW

Compared `post-init_requirements.txt` (actual runtime with rknn-toolkit-lite2) with `wmt_requirements.txt` (desired):

### ✅ Successfully Installed (54/59 active packages = 91.5%)
Including the critical **rknn-toolkit-lite2==2.3.2** which enables RKNN hardware acceleration!

### 🔴 Still Missing Critical Packages (5 packages):
1. **scikit-image==0.24.0** - Advanced image processing algorithms (Python 3.8 incompatible)
2. **torch==2.5.1** - PyTorch deep learning framework (complex ARM64 setup)
3. **torchvision==0.20.1** - PyTorch vision utilities
4. **tifffile==2025.6.11** - TIFF file format support (requires Python >=3.10)
5. **tzdata==2025.2** - Python timezone database (should be installable)

Note: onnxruntime, ultralytics, and ultralytics-thop are commented out in wmt_requirements.txt

### 🟡 Major Version Gaps Due to Python 3.8 Constraints:
- **matplotlib**: 3.7.5 vs 3.10.3 (3.10 requires Python >=3.9)
- **pandas**: 1.3.5 vs 2.3.0 (2.3 requires Python >=3.9)
- **Pillow**: 6.2.1 vs 11.2.1 (11.x requires Python >=3.9)
- **numpy**: 1.24.4 vs 2.3.0 (2.x requires Python >=3.10)
- **imageio**: 2.6.0 vs 2.37.0 (significant gap but functional)

### 🎯 Current Capabilities:
**CAN RUN:**
- ✅ RKNN models via rknn-toolkit-lite2 (BrightSign hardware accelerated!)
- ✅ Basic OpenCV operations (4.11.0.86)
- ✅ Matplotlib visualizations (3.7.5)
- ✅ Basic numpy/scipy computations (1.24.4/1.10.1)
- ✅ Data analysis with pandas (1.3.5)
- ✅ Image I/O with imageio and Pillow (older versions)

**CANNOT RUN WITHOUT ADDITIONAL SETUP:**
- ❌ PyTorch models (requires manual ARM64 wheel installation)
- ❌ Advanced scikit-image algorithms (needs older version or build from source)
- ❌ Modern TIFF file support (needs older tifffile version)
- ❌ Latest features requiring Python >=3.9 libraries

## Python 3.8 Compatibility Analysis

### 🚫 Incompatible with Desired Versions:
All the desired major versions of key packages are **incompatible with Python 3.8**:
- **numpy 2.3.0**: Requires Python >=3.10
- **pandas 2.3.0**: Requires Python >=3.9
- **matplotlib 3.10.3**: Requires Python >=3.9
- **Pillow 11.2.1**: Requires Python >=3.9
- **scikit-image 0.24.0**: Requires Python >=3.10
- **tifffile 2025.6.11**: Requires Python >=3.10

### ✅ Workarounds Available:
1. **PyTorch/torchvision**: ARM64 wheels available, install from PyPI or alternative sources
2. **tifffile**: Use older version `pip install "tifffile<2023.7.10"`
3. **tzdata**: Pure Python, should install directly `pip install tzdata`
4. **scikit-image**: Try older versions (0.19.x) or build from source

## Key Takeaway
The BrightSign environment with Python 3.8 has fundamental compatibility limitations with modern CV/ML packages. While 91.5% of packages are installed, they are older versions due to Python 3.8 constraints. The environment is functional for basic CV/ML tasks and RKNN hardware acceleration, but lacks support for cutting-edge features that require Python >=3.9.
