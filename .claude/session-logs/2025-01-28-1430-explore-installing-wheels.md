# Session Log: Exploring Installing Wheels in BrightSign Extension

**Date**: 2025-01-28 14:30  
**Topic**: explore installing wheels  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Participants**: Scott (user), Claude (L7 SDE debugging expert)

## Executive Summary

Investigated the root cause of RKNN toolkit initialization failures in the BrightSign Python CV Extension. Initially suspected library path issues with `librknnrt.so`, but discovered the actual problem: the Python package `rknn-toolkit-lite2` was not being installed into the extension's site-packages directory.

**Key Discovery**: Python wheels are ZIP archives that can be safely extracted on x86_64 build machines for ARM64 targets without architectural concerns.

## Problem Investigation Journey

### Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect)
- **Assumed**: `librknnrt.so` library path resolution issue
- **Error Message**: "Can not find dynamic library on RK3588!"
- **Attempted Solutions**: LD_PRELOAD, symlinks, environment variables
- **Result**: All failed because the real issue was elsewhere

### Evidence Gathering
**Player Filesystem Analysis:**
```bash
# Library was actually present:
/usr/local/lib64/librknnrt.so              # ✅ Symlink created by setup_python_env
/usr/local/usr/lib/librknnrt.so            # ✅ From development deployment
/var/volatile/bsext/ext_npu_obj/.../       # ✅ From other extensions

# But Python package was missing:
pip3 freeze | grep rknn  # No output - package not installed!
```

### Root Cause Discovery
**The real issue**: `copy_rknn_wheel()` function in `package` script was only copying the wheel file, not extracting/installing it:

```bash
# Current (broken) implementation:
copy_rknn_wheel() {
    mkdir -p install/usr/lib/python3.8/wheels
    cp "$wheel_path" install/usr/lib/python3.8/wheels/  # Just copied, not installed!
}
```

## Architecture Understanding Breakthrough

### Three-Environment Model
1. **Build Machine (x86_64)**: Cross-compilation and packaging
2. **SDK (Extracted Toolchain)**: Target libraries and cross-compiler
3. **Target Player (ARM64)**: Two deployment modes (development/production)

### Critical Insight: Wheel Architecture Safety
**Python wheels are ZIP archives** containing:
- Pure Python code (architecture-agnostic)
- Compiled binaries for specific architecture (`.cpython-38-aarch64-linux-gnu.so`)
- Package metadata (`.dist-info/`)

**Safe Operations on Build Machine:**
- ✅ Extract wheel (unzip operation)
- ✅ Copy ARM64 binaries (no execution)
- ✅ Install to staging directory

**Wheel Contents Analysis:**
```bash
# Verified ARM64 architecture:
unzip -l rknn_toolkit_lite2-2.3.2-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl
# Contains: rknn_runtime.cpython-38-aarch64-linux-gnu.so (ARM64 binary)
```

## Solution Development

### Final Solution: Extract Wheel During Packaging
**Replace `copy_rknn_wheel()` with proper installation:**

```bash
copy_rknn_wheel() {
    log "Installing rknn-toolkit-lite2 into extension site-packages..."
    
    local wheel_path="toolkit/rknn-toolkit2/rknn-toolkit-lite2/packages/rknn_toolkit_lite2-2.3.2-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl"
    
    if [[ -f "$wheel_path" ]]; then
        # Extract wheel contents (wheel is just a ZIP file)
        local temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
        unzip -q "$wheel_path" -d "$temp_dir"
        
        # Install to site-packages in staging area
        local site_packages="install/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages"
        mkdir -p "$site_packages"
        
        # Copy package and metadata
        cp -r "$temp_dir/rknnlite" "$site_packages/"
        cp -r "$temp_dir"/rknn_toolkit_lite2*.dist-info "$site_packages/"
        
        rm -rf "$temp_dir"
        success "rknn-toolkit-lite2 installed into extension"
    fi
}
```

## Key Technical Insights

### Wheel Installation Patterns
1. **Wheels are ZIP archives** - can be extracted with standard unzip
2. **Architecture safety** - extracting ARM64 files on x86_64 is safe (no execution)
3. **Standard structure** - `package/` + `*.dist-info/` directories
4. **Metadata importance** - `.dist-info/` needed for proper pip recognition

### Build System Architecture
- **Docker-based builds** with pre-embedded source (19GB)
- **Recipe overlay system** using rsync to apply patches
- **Cross-compilation** from x86_64 to ARM64
- **SDK extraction** for packaging target libraries

### BrightSign Filesystem Constraints
- **Read-only**: `/usr/lib/`, most of root filesystem
- **Read-write executable**: `/usr/local/`, `/var/volatile/`
- **Extensions mount at**: `/var/volatile/bsext/ext_pydev/`

## Documentation Created

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **`plans/architecture-understanding.md`** - Complete system architecture
2. **`plans/fix-librknnrt.md`** - Updated with correct solution
3. **Session log** - This document

### Key Documents:
- **Problem analysis** with correct root cause
- **Implementation plan** with wheel extraction approach
- **Testing strategy** for validation
- **Architecture documentation** for future reference

## Testing Strategy

### Local Validation:
```bash
./package --dev-only
ls -la install/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/rknnlite/  # Should exist
file install/usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/rknnlite/api/*.so  # ARM64 binaries
```

### Player Testing:
```python
# After deployment and environment setup:
import pkg_resources
print(pkg_resources.get_distribution('rknn-toolkit-lite2'))  # Should show 2.3.2

from rknnlite.api import RKNNLite
rknn = RKNNLite()  # Should initialize successfully
```

## Lessons Learned

### Investigation Methodology
1. **Evidence gathering is critical** - Player filesystem analysis revealed the truth
2. **Question assumptions** - Library path wasn't the issue
3. **Understand the build pipeline** - Packaging vs runtime installation differences matter

### Technical Patterns
1. **Wheel extraction is architecture-safe** for cross-compilation scenarios
2. **Python packaging requires both code and metadata** - don't forget `.dist-info/`
3. **Staging directories** allow safe manipulation before deployment

### BrightSign-Specific Knowledge
1. **Extensions vs development deployments** have different paths
2. **Runtime pip installation** doesn't work reliably on read-only systems
3. **Pre-installation during packaging** is the correct approach

## Action Items

### Immediate (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement new `copy_rknn_wheel()` function in package script
- [ ] Test packaging process locally
- [ ] Deploy and validate on player

### Documentation (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Update `BUGS.md` with resolution
- [ ] Update `TODO.md` to remove resolved items
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section to README

### Future Considerations (Low Priority)
- [ ] Consider BitBake recipe approach for proper SDK integration
- [ ] Document wheel installation patterns for other packages
- [ ] Create validation script for package installations

## Reusable Patterns

### Cross-Architecture Wheel Installation
```bash
# Safe pattern for installing ARM64 wheels on x86_64 build machine:
extract_wheel_to_staging() {
    local wheel_path="$1"
    local staging_dir="$2"
    local temp_dir=$(mktemp -d)
    
    unzip -q "$wheel_path" -d "$temp_dir"
    cp -r "$temp_dir"/* "$staging_dir/"
    rm -rf "$temp_dir"
}
```

### Package Validation
```bash
# Verify package installation completeness:
validate_package_installation() {
    local site_packages="$1"
    local package_name="$2"
    
    # Check package directory exists
    [[ -d "$site_packages/$package_name" ]] || return 1
    
    # Check metadata exists
    ls "$site_packages"/${package_name}*.dist-info/ &>/dev/null || return 1
    
    # Verify binary architecture (if applicable)
    find "$site_packages/$package_name" -name "*.so" -exec file {} \; | grep -q aarch64
}
```

## Key Quotes from Session

> "you misundersatnd the environemnt. the lib is installed in the OS at /usr/local/lib64/librknnrt.so"

This comment was the turning point that led to the correct understanding of the three-environment architecture.

> "my understanding of wheels is limited so i defer to you as the expert. since this new function copy_rknn_wheel will run on the build machine, will it find the right architecture and install the right files for the TARGET? Is a wheel just a zip?"

This question led to the critical insight about wheel architecture safety and the ZIP format.

## Next Session Preparation

**Context for next session:**
- Implementation of the new `copy_rknn_wheel()` function
- Testing and validation of the wheel installation approach
- Potential follow-up issues or optimizations

**Files to review:**
- `package` script for implementation
- `plans/fix-librknnrt.md` for current solution status
- `install/` directory structure after packaging
