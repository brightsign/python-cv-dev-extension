# TODOs

Backlog of issues to be handled while working on other things.

[ ] BUGS has a report of not being able to find librknnrt.so.  I think the plan in fix-librknnrt.md is offbase. Consider how to PROPERLY install the package `rknn-toolkit-lite2`.  We had recommended installing this by wheel... but that doesn't seem to be working.

consider:
* how to install the files from the wheel into the SDK and extension -- this may need some remapping of paths?
* the source for the package is closed
*
```
