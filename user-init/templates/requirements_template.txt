# Python Requirements Template
# Copy this file to requirements.txt and customize for your needs
# Place in /storage/sd/python-init/ for automatic installation at startup
#
# IMPORTANT: Only packages with ARM64/aarch64 wheels will install successfully.
# The player has no build system (cmake, gcc, etc.) so packages requiring 
# compilation will fail.

# Computer Vision packages

# Notes:
# - Use version pinning (==1.0.0) for reproducible installs

# - Large packages like TensorFlow can take 10+ minutes to install
# - Only packages with pre-compiled ARM64 wheels will work (no compilation on device)
